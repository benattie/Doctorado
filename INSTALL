INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR IDEA and IDEA-WH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instalation in linux distributions is quite straight forward:
A. Install dependences (in Synaptic):
    1. Open for Synaptic or any other package manager.
    2. Select the GSL related packages: gsl-bin, libgsl-dev, libgsl-dbg, libgsl2.
    3. Select gcc and make packages.
    4. Press apply to install the dependences

    NOTE: the code needs a GSL version 1.16 or superior.

B. Once the dependences are installed:
    1. Download the code from Github (https://github.com/benattie/Doctorado.git)
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder idea-3.3
    3. Run "make"
    4. Done. There should be an .exe file with the IDEA executable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instalation in Windows OS is not as easy as in linux, because the GSL library doesn't natively run on Windows, and must be emulated trough Cygwin.

A. Install Cygwin
    1. Go to http://cygwin.com/install.html and choose and download the cygwin version suited for your computer (64-bit or 32-bit).
    2. Execute the .exe file, accepting everything you are asked for.
    3. Choose a mirror for downloading and then click Next
    4. Choose the following packages for installing (change Default for Install):
        Archive/zip
        Devel/automake1.10
        Devel/binutils
        Devel/gcc-core
        Devel/gcc-fortran
        Devel/gcc-g++
        Devel/gcc-objc
        Devel/gcc-objc++
        Devel/git
        Devel/git-cvs
        Devel/git-gui
        Devel/gitk
        Devel/make
        Editors/geany
        Editors/geany-devel
        Editors/geany-plugins-addons
        Editors/geany-plugins-common
        Editors/geany-plugins-debugger
        Editors/geany-plugins-geanyctags
        Math/libopenblas
        Math/openblas
        Libs/libgsl-devel
        Libs/libgsl0
        Science/gsl
        X11/ - All dependences

        And then click "Next" as many times as is necessary.

    5. Have a cup of tea, the program will download and install all packages.

B. Install IDEA
    1. Open Cygwin
    2. Type the following line in your cygwin terminal:
	    git clone https://github.com/benattie/Doctorado
    and wait to the file to be dowloaded
    3. cd Doctorado/idea-3.3
    4. make
    5. A file called idea.exe should now be created

NOTE: for accesing Windows folders inside cygwin

If your data files are in C:\Users\hornero\Documents\Cu70R
You can go to the Cu70R folder by writting:
	cd /cygdrive/c/Users/hornero/Documents/Cu70R
You can always use the comand "ls" (whitout the quotes) for checking the content of the current folder.

NOTE: for more information about how to use IDEA see the README.tex file inside the idea-3.3 folder.

TROUBLESHOOTING
If you install an old version of the GSL you may see a warning that has a line like this:

some lines some lines some lines

pv_steps.c:282:5: warning: implicit declaration of function 'gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_jac' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
    gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_jac(s, J);
    ^
some lines some lines some lines

make: *** [Makefile:16: idea] Error 1

In that case, you have to open the file pv_steps.c and look for the lines which contain the function gsl_multifit_fdfsolver_jac(s, J);
There you'll find instruction to comment and uncomment some lines in order to solve the problem. I'm currently working in a more robust solution to this problem.

INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR IDEA-CMWP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Dependencies
    For running IDEA-CMWP in Linux, first you have to install the software needed for running CMWP. In addition to everything that was installed with IDEA (see above), you should install the gv and zsh packages.
    In Debian based systems this is acomplished by opening a terminal and typing:

        apt-get install gv zsh

Press enter afterwards.

B. Install CMWP
    1. Download the CMWP package from http://csendes.elte.hu/cmwp/
    2. You will download a .tar.gz file. For this example we will call the file CMWP-current.tar.gz. Move the file wherever is convenient for you.
    3. Open a terminal and go to the folder where the .tar.gz file is:

        cd /path/to/the/tar_file

    4. Extract the contents of the by typing:

        tar -xfv CMWP-current.tar.gz

    5. Go to the newly created folder and open the INSTALL file with your favorite text editor. In the file you'll find the installation instructions for CMWP.
    6. Install the software following the instructions provided by it.

C. Install IDEA-CMWP
    1. Using the terminal, go to the folder idea-CMWP, that should be next to the idea-3.3 folder (see installation of IDEA, above)
    2. Type:
        
        make
    
    3. A file named idea-cmwp.exe should be created.
    4. Copy this file to the CMWP folder.
    5. Copy the python folder to the CMWP folder.
    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Dependencies
    1. Run Cygwin setup.
    2. In addition to everything that was installed during the installation of IDEA, add the following dependencies:
        Graphics/gv
        Shells/zsh
        Libs/libX11-devel
        Libs/libXt-devel

B. Install Java
    1. Go to https://www.java.com/ and download and install the current version of JAVA for your operating system.

C. Enable the graphic interphase
    1. Go to Start Menu, and right-click on "Equipment".
    2. Click on "Properties". A new window will be open.
    3. On this window click on "Advanced system configuration". Another window will open.
    4. Go to "Advanced settings", and then click on "Enviroment variables".
    5. This should bring up another window. In the bottom half of the screen (System variables), select the line called Path, and click "Edit"
    6. Go to the end of the line and add this: 

        ;C:\cygwin\bin;C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101

    NOTE: You should change C:\cygwin\bin and C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin for the actual location of the Cygwin folder, which may be different depending on how did you install Cygwin.
    NOTE2: Change C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101 for the path to the folder where Java was installed.

    7. Click OK to save this change
    8. Click OK to close the Environment window
    9. Click OK to close the System properties

D. Set path to Java on Linux
    1. In the cygwin home folder, look for the file named .bash_profile (create it if necessary) and add this lines at the end of the file:

        # Add java path
        export JAVA_HOME="/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_101/"
        export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

C. Install CMWP
    1. Go to http://csendes.elte.hu/cmwp/ and download the CMWP installer.
    2. You will download a .tar.gz file. For this example we will call the file CMWP-current.tar.gz. Move the file wherever is convenient for you.
    3. Move this file to your Cygwin home folder.
    4. Open the Cygwin Terminal and go to wherever you put the file CMWP-current.tar.gz.
    5. Extract the file:

        tar -xfv CMWP-current.tar.gz
    6. A new folder will be created, cd into that folder.
    7. Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file in order to install CMWP.

D. Build IDEA-CMWP
    1. While in the Cygwin terminal
cd IDEA-CMWP
make

E. Set everything
Copy python and idea-cmwp.exe a CMWP
