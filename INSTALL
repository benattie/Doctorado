INSTALATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR IDEA and IDEA-WH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instalation in linux distributions is quite straight forward:
A. Install dependences (in Synaptic):
    1. Open for Synaptic or any other package manager.
    2. Select the GSL related packages: gsl-bin, libgsl-dev, libgsl-dbg, libgsl2.
    3. Select gcc and make packages.
    4. Press apply to install the dependences

    NOTE: the code needs a GSL version 1.16 or superior.

B. Once the dependences are installed:
    1. Download the code from Github (https://github.com/benattie/Doctorado.git)
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder idea-3.3
    3. Run "make"
    4. Done. There should be an .exe file with the IDEA executable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instalation in Windows OS is not as easy as in linux, because the GSL library doesn't natively run on Windows, and must be emulated trough Cygwin.

A. Install Cygwin
    1. Go to http://cygwin.com/install.html and choose and download the cygwin version suited for your computer (64-bit or 32-bit).
    2. Execute the .exe file, accepting everything you are asked for.
    3. Choose a mirror for downloading and then click Next
    4. Choose the following packages for installing (change Default for Install):
        Archive/zip
        Devel/automake1.9
        Devel/binutils
        Devel/gcc-core
        Devel/gcc-fortran
        Devel/gcc-g++
        Devel/gcc-objc
        Devel/gcc-objc++
        Devel/git
        Devel/git-cvs
        Devel/git-gui
        Devel/gitk
        Devel/make
        Editors/geany
        Editors/geany-devel
        Editors/geany-plugins-addons
        Editors/geany-plugins-common
        Editors/geany-plugins-deugger
        Editors/geany-plugins-geanyctags
        Math/libopenblas
        Math/openblas
        Libs/libgsl-devel
        Libs/libgsl0
        Science/gsl
        X11

        And then click "Next" as many times as is necessary.

    5. Have a cup of tea, the program will download and install all packages.

B. Install IDEA
    1. Open Cygwin
    2. Type the following line in your cygwin terminal:
	    git clone https://github.com/benattie/Doctorado
    and wait to the file to be dowloaded
    3. cd Doctorado/idea-3.3
    4. make
    5. A file called idea.exe should now be created

NOTE: for accesing Windows folders inside cygwin

If your data files are in C:\Users\hornero\Documents\Cu70R
You can go to the Cu70R folder by writting:
	cd /cygdrive/c/Users/hornero/Documents/Cu70R
You can always use the comand "ls" (whitout the quotes) for checking the content of the current folder.

NOTE: for more information about how to use IDEA see the README.tex file inside the idea-3.3 folder.
